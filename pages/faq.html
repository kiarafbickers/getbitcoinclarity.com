        <a>Question: How do I get started with Bitcoin Clarity? What are the price details?</a>
        <div class="content">
        <p><b>Answer:</b> In an ideal world, I'd love to work with everyone 1-on-1, but because cloning me is not yet an option I've created a scale of different ways to work with me. The Book, The Accelerator, and The Inner Circle. The Book you can get in print in the US and Canada now! For The Accelerator you have to apply. And to work with me 1-on-1 you'll also apply, and we'll work out the details on your scheduled call.</p>

        <a>Question: Why is The Book only available on this site, and on Amazon as a preorder (Release Date: 03/27/20)?</a>
        <div class="content">
        <p><b>Answer:</b> As a first time self-published author I'd prefer to sell directly to you than on Amazon. That being said, shipping abroad from the US is not cost-effective. So I've opened up preorders on Amazon for ebook (and soon for print) to release next year the day of the Bitcoin 2020 event.</p>
