What does it mean to expand it? And how does that affect us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we hearing about the federal reserve expanding its balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the FEDs balance sheet different from the average businesses? What typical constraints are they not limited by?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way money is created in the economy isn’t magic, although there is good reason that it appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every investor watches what the FED does, and aims to derive some cause and effect from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions of the FED don’t happen for no reason, they take deliberate moves that they believe will have the greatest impact on the economy, consumer prices, and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But realistically, the actions of the FED also affect every other part of market (stocks, commodities, gold, and crypto) and that’s why investors follow their every move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s video I show you what it means for the FED to be expanding its balance sheet, when is full-blown quantitive easing, and when is it not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-what-i-cover&quot;&gt;HERE’S WHAT I COVER:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does consumer and investor spending differ from Federal Reserve spending?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are US Treasury assets are a lot like consumer credit cards?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3 primary types of US Treasury assets, what they are and how they differ from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the Federal Reserve is buying US Treasury assets, and why we can’t ignore it!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why people are confusing the FED expanding its balance sheet for quantitative easing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to see the details of this central bank maneuver and judge for yourself on what this move really means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is young and it’s not going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge opportunity here for anyone willing to learn something about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are several serious problems why trying to learn about Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-propaganda--disinformation&quot;&gt;1. Propaganda &amp;amp; Disinformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“X is the real Bitcoin”*
“X cryptocurrency is faster, cheaper, and better than Bitcoin”*
“Bitcoin is dead, Y is the next Bitcoin”*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creators and promoters of competing cryptocurrencies have a direct incentive to create misleading information and promote their cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity ability and intent to mislead consumers is all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is an authoritative place to learn about using Bitcoin? There isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem in understanding Bitcoin is that.. Bitcoin is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re a cryptographer or developer, you really have no way of understanding Bitcoin on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people that want to learn about Bitcoin, but they don’t know where to start or who to trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to a doctor or lawyer, if you don’t believe one expert, the best option you have is to get the opinion of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise in crypto, you have to decide whose opinion you’re going to trust..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re economics nerd friend, some guru on Twitter, or your financial advisor,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who they are determines what type of Bitcoin propaganda they sell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “digital gold”: Bitcoin is a digital security and a store of value.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “cypherpunk money”: Bitcoin is a way to transfer value securely over the insecure internet.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “a dumb investment”: Bitcoin is the first of the highly volatile cryptocurrency asset class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is subject to bias and the solution to that is transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-clarity&quot;&gt;2. Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt; is a way of being coherent and transparent about your thoughts, to communicate what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I focus on answering three simple questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How does Bitcoin work?
Why does it work?
And is it valuable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With three simple tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Visuals
Mental models
And systems thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sketched out hundreds images to visually explain everything about how it works. Then I got a great artist that I met at my local coffee shop to redraw it. (Shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/jordan.wesolek/&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; for doing an amazing job with that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Bitcoin developers to create the mental models that accurately map to the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;main-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/bitcoin-clarity-mining-02.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with traders to cover to the section on markets and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;main-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/bitcoin-clarity-markets-03.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I used systems thinking to structure the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made this as easy as possible for truly the average person to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular people don’t want an expert to tell them what Bitcoin is, they want to be showed what it is, by giving them new ways to see it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without code, economics, or cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbitcoinclarity.sale/product/book/&quot;&gt;The book is available for preorder here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for people who want &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getbitcoinclarity.com&quot;&gt;group training I’ve created that here&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kiara bickers</name></author><category term="purpose" /><summary type="html">In 2017, “What is Bitcoin?” was the most Googled question, and two years later still, nobody is exactly sure what it is.
