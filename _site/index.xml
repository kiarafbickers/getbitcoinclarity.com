&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;header pic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bitcoin key is not just one key but two keys. A &lt;b&gt;public key&lt;/b&gt; is the key that allows bitcoin to be locked and received. While the &lt;b&gt;private key&lt;/b&gt;  is the key that allows bitcoin to be unlocked and spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Wiki and technical documentation will often explain keys as large numbers. Although technically true, I think it’s easier just to gloss over that. Let’s leave the “crypto” to the cryptographers. This is the simplest way to explain Bitcoin keys that I’ve been able to pull together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the typical lock that can lock and unlock, Bitcoins use of &lt;b&gt;public-key cryptography&lt;/b&gt; splits that functionality into two keys. The unlocking function simultaneously sends, and the receiving functionality simultaneously locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-private-key-unlocks-and-sends&quot;&gt;A Private Key Unlocks and Sends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private keys are the instructions for moving bitcoin on the blockchain. That fact that no one can move your Bitcoin without your private key has both its advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that you are fully reasonable for your funds. The main disadvantage is &lt;b&gt;you are fully reasonable for your funds&lt;/b&gt;. As the term suggests your private key should remain private. Once you send funds from a key you own to address associated with a private key someone else controls, you no longer control those funds. Transactions are fully &lt;b&gt;irreversible&lt;/b&gt;, so this means you want to be thoughtful about what transactions you authorize and what wallet software you trust to manage your private keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-public-key-is-created-from-the-private-key&quot;&gt;The Public Key is Created from The Private Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the public key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-public-key-locks-and-receives&quot;&gt;A Public Key Locks and Receives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Keys are instructions for locking Bitcoin on the blockchain. When you receive Bitcoin you typically receive them at a bitcoin address you’ve provided to the sender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-public-key-is-created-from-the-private-key-1&quot;&gt;The Public Key is Created from The Private Key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The address is really just a smaller version of the public key but the functionality is largely the same, &lt;b&gt;bitcoin addresses&lt;/b&gt; lock up bitcoins on your behalf. Public keys are invented to be public and shared, but they shouldn’t be reused. Address and public keys are intended to be used only once, as a one-time location on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have shown a literal example of bitcoin public and private keys, but let’s be honest, it’s not exactly pretty. Bitcoin is far from easy to use, but I hope this expiation has helped some. For most users, this would be the minimum amount of information needed on keys to feel conformable enough in using Bitcoin. Maybe later I’ll come back and over complicate this by explaining Hierarchical deterministic (HD) keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-conclusions&quot;&gt;Final Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public and private keys are used both used simultaneously in a transaction. Private keys unlock the bitcoin being sent, by proving they own the bitcoin they’re sending. Whereas the public key is used to lock up the bitcoin at the new address for the recipient. Private keys are almost never interacted with by users because they’re managed by the users’ wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

How is it measured? What does a high or low network hashrate indicate for the rest of the Bitcoin network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago the price of Bitcoin crashed from $10,000 to $8,000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception was that the Bitcoin hashrate had crashed 30%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors view the total network hashrate as a bid for miners to buy the bitcoins being released in the next block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High hashrate tends to move the price up. Low hashrate tends to move the price down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because people misunderstand how hashrate is measured investors saw a “crash” in hashrate that didn’t reflect reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s video, I show you what hashrate is, AND how it’s measured, so you understand why this crash wasn’t real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HERE’S WHAT I COVER:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What hashrate is. (The total number of hashes being computed by the miners in the network)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How you can instead think of the blockchain as a timechain, or a decentralized clock. Why that clock needs to keep time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3 primary types of clocks and how Bitcoins timechain is different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the timing of this decentralized clock is measured with blocks and regulated by proof-of-work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the blockchain is trustless. (It doesn’t check any 3rd party source of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the blockchain is permissionless. (Miners are allowed to join or drop off at any time.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the property of permissionless, makes regulating the timing of new blocks tricky. And how it’s controlled by a feedback control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

What does it mean to expand it? And how does that affect us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we hearing about the federal reserve expanding its balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the FEDs balance sheet different from the average businesses? What typical constraints are they not limited by?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way money is created in the economy isn’t magic, although there is good reason that it appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every investor watches what the FED does, and aims to derive some cause and effect from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions of the FED don’t happen for no reason, they take deliberate moves that they believe will have the greatest impact on the economy, consumer prices, and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But realistically, the actions of the FED also affect every other part of market (stocks, commodities, gold, and crypto) and that’s why investors follow their every move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s video I show you what it means for the FED to be expanding its balance sheet, when is full-blown quantitive easing, and when is it not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does consumer and investor spending differ from Federal Reserve spending?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is young and it’s not going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge opportunity here for anyone willing to learn something about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are several serious problems why trying to learn about Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-propaganda--disinformation&quot;&gt;1. Propaganda &amp;amp; Disinformation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“X is the real Bitcoin”*
“X cryptocurrency is faster, cheaper, and better than Bitcoin”*
“Bitcoin is dead, Y is the next Bitcoin”*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creators and promoters of competing cryptocurrencies have a direct incentive to create misleading information and promote their cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity ability and intent to mislead consumers is all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is an authoritative place to learn about using Bitcoin? There isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem in understanding Bitcoin is that.. Bitcoin is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re a cryptographer or developer, you really have no way of understanding Bitcoin on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people that want to learn about Bitcoin, but they don’t know where to start or who to trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to a doctor or lawyer, if you don’t believe one expert, the best option you have is to get the opinion of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise in crypto, you have to decide whose opinion you’re going to trust..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re economics nerd friend, some guru on Twitter, or your financial advisor,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who they are determines what type of Bitcoin propaganda they sell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “digital gold”: Bitcoin is a digital security and a store of value.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “cypherpunk money”: Bitcoin is a way to transfer value securely over the insecure internet.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “a dumb investment”: Bitcoin is the first of the highly volatile cryptocurrency asset class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is subject to bias and the solution to that is transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-clarity&quot;&gt;2. Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt; is a way of being coherent and transparent about your thoughts, to communicate what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I focus on answering three simple questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How does Bitcoin work?
Why does it work?
And is it valuable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With three simple tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Visuals
Mental models
And systems thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sketched out hundreds images to visually explain everything about how it works. Then I got a great artist that I met at my local coffee shop to redraw it. (Shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/jordan.wesolek/&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; for doing an amazing job with that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Bitcoin developers to create the mental models that accurately map to the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;main-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/bitcoin-clarity-mining-02.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with traders to cover to the section on markets and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;main-responsive center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/blog/bitcoin-clarity-markets-03.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I used systems thinking to structure the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made this as easy as possible for truly the average person to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular people don’t want an expert to tell them what Bitcoin is, they want to be showed what it is, by giving them new ways to see it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without code, economics, or cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
