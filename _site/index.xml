&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is young and it’s not going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge opportunity here for anyone willing to learn something about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are several serious problems why trying to learn about Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;**☩ PROPAGANDA &amp;amp; DISINFORMATION ☩**&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“X is the real Bitcoin”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“X cryptocurrency is faster, cheaper, and better than Bitcoin”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Bitcoin is dead, Y is the next Bitcoin”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creators and promoters of competing cryptocurrencies have a direct incentive to create misleading information and promote their cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity ability and intent to mislead consumers is all there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is an authoritative place to learn about using Bitcoin? There isn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem in understanding Bitcoin is that.. Bitcoin is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re a cryptographer or developer, you really have no way of understanding Bitcoin on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-are-millions-of-people-that-want-to-learn-about-bitcoin-but-they-dont-know-where-to-start-or-who-to-trust&quot;&gt;There are millions of people that want to learn about Bitcoin, but they don’t know where to start or who to trust.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to a doctor or lawyer, if you don’t believe one expert, the best option you have is to get the opinion of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise in crypto, you have to decide whose opinion you’re going to trust..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re economics nerd friend, some guru on Twitter, or your financial advisor,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who they are determines what type of Bitcoin propaganda they sell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “digital gold”: Bitcoin is a digital security and a store of value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “cypherpunk money”: Bitcoin is a way to transfer value securely over the insecure internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin as “a dumb investment”: Bitcoin is the first of the highly volatile cryptocurrency asset class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is subject to bias and the solution to that is transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;**☩ CLARITY ☩**&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity&lt;/strong&gt; is a way of being coherent and transparent about your thoughts, to communicate what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I focus on answering three simple questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does Bitcoin work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why does it work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And is it valuable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With three simple tools:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visuals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mental models&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-art-of-problem-solving-by-russell-ackoff/&quot;&gt;Systems Thinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sketched out hundreds images to visually explain everything about how it works. Then I got a great artist that I met at my local coffee shop to redraw it. (Shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/jordan.wesolek/&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; for doing an amazing job with that!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Bitcoin developers to create the mental models that accurately map to the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin-clarity-mining-02.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with traders to cover to the section on markets and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/bitcoin-clarity-markets-03.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I used &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-art-of-problem-solving-by-russell-ackoff/&quot;&gt;systems thinking&lt;/a&gt; to structure the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made this as easy as possible for truly the average person to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular people don’t want an expert to tell them what Bitcoin is, they want to be showed what it is, by giving them new ways to see it for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without code, economics, or cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbitcoinclarity.sale/product/book/&quot;&gt;The book is available for preorder here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for people who want &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getbitcoinclarity.com&quot;&gt;group training I’ve created that here&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kiara bickers</name></author><category term="purpose" /><summary type="html">In 2017, “What is Bitcoin?” was the most Googled question, and two years later still, nobody is exactly sure what it is.
