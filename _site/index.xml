The key pair consists of a private key to unlock and send bitcoin, and derived from it is a series of public keys that are used to receive and lock bitcoin. Addresses are smaller versions of public keys, that serves as your one-time location on the blockchain. When providing someone with a bitcoin address you’re giving them the ability to lock up bitcoin on your behalf, at a location you control with your private key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-are-bitcoin-private-keys-generated&quot;&gt;How are bitcoin private keys generated?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random numbers are a big deal in nearly every cryptographic system. In Bitcoin, private keys are generated from a very large random number also called a seed. The set of possible numbers is so large, that security of bitcoin relies on the assumption that no one will every randomly generate the same private key twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase-mnemonic-recovery-phrase-or-bitcoin-seed&quot;&gt;What is a mnemonic phrase, mnemonic recovery phrase, or bitcoin seed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, numbers can be expressed as words (zero) and numerical digits (0), the private key is just a very large number that has the same properties. Instead of using the literal word expression of the random private key number (vigintillion, googol, or centillion), bitcoin uses a list of 12 or 24 random words to represent the random number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As specified in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki&quot;&gt;BIP39&lt;/a&gt;, the motivation for this mnemonic is make private keys human-readable, so they can be easily written down as a backup to a private key, or spoken over the telephone and easily shared. A password can also be added to the phrase, to add some additional protection to your private key backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-is-the-bitcoin-actually-stored&quot;&gt;Where is the bitcoin actually stored?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blockchain is an evolution in databases. Previously databases only recorded and logged transfers of value, but on the blockchain, the value is stored on this ledger directly. Coins are stored in smart contracts (more specifically the scriptPubKey, also called the locking script, or a UTXO) on the blockchain. When you initate a transaction you create a signature with your private key, to unlock a specific batch of bitcoin on the blockchain, proving that you are authorized to move those funds. Your private key gives you control over your bitcoin, and is not stored on the blockchain but in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kiara bickers</name></author><category term="bitcoin" /><category term="private" /><category term="keys," /><category term="bitcoin" /><category term="public" /><category term="keys" /><summary type="html">Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography to create a key pair that controls your access to bitcoin on the blockchain.

How is it measured? What does a high or low network hashrate indicate for the rest of the Bitcoin network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago the price of Bitcoin crashed from $10,000 to $8,000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception was that the Bitcoin hashrate had crashed 30%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors view the total network hashrate as a bid for miners to buy the bitcoins being released in the next block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High hashrate tends to move the price up. Low hashrate tends to move the price down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because people misunderstand how hashrate is measured investors saw a “crash” in hashrate that didn’t reflect reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s video, I show you what hashrate is, AND how it’s measured, so you understand why this crash wasn’t real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-what-i-cover&quot;&gt;HERE’S WHAT I COVER:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What hashrate is. (The total number of hashes being computed by the miners in the network)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How you can instead think of the blockchain as a timechain, or a decentralized clock. Why that clock needs to keep time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3 primary types of clocks and how Bitcoins timechain is different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the timing of this decentralized clock is measured with blocks and regulated by proof-of-work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the blockchain is trustless. (It doesn’t check any 3rd party source of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the blockchain is permissionless. (Miners are allowed to join or drop off at any time.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the property of permissionless, makes regulating the timing of new blocks tricky. And how it’s controlled by a feedback control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

What does it mean to expand it? And how does that affect us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we hearing about the federal reserve expanding its balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the FEDs balance sheet different from the average businesses? What typical constraints are they not limited by?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way money is created in the economy isn’t magic, although there is good reason that it appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every investor watches what the FED does, and aims to derive some cause and effect from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actions of the FED don’t happen for no reason, they take deliberate moves that they believe will have the greatest impact on the economy, consumer prices, and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But realistically, the actions of the FED also affect every other part of market (stocks, commodities, gold, and crypto) and that’s why investors follow their every move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s video I show you what it means for the FED to be expanding its balance sheet, when is full-blown quantitive easing, and when is it not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heres-what-i-cover&quot;&gt;HERE’S WHAT I COVER:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does the average business balance sheet compare with the Federal Reserves’ balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does consumer and investor spending differ from Federal Reserve spending?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are US Treasury assets are a lot like consumer credit cards?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3 primary types of US Treasury assets, what they are and how they differ from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why the Federal Reserve is buying US Treasury assets, and why we can’t ignore it!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why people are confusing the FED expanding its balance sheet for quantitative easing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
