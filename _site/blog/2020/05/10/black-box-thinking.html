<meta name="description" content="What is the best bitcoin wallet? Let’s help you choose a bitcoin wallet . . . Step 1: Decide if you want to store your own keys Controlling your own private keys are the only way to be fully in control and have access to your bitcoin, but that also means that you’re fully responsibly for protecting your keys and its backup. Exchanges or custodial wallets will provide the service of storing your private keys on your behalf, which is great for new users. But this also means that you’re full relying on the exchange to be a custodian of your private keys. TIP: For long-term storage consider using a hardware wallet. Step 2: Do you prioritize privacy or security? In Bitcoin, there are privacy focused wallets and there are security focused wallets. The goal of privacy focused wallets is to stop your transactions on the blockchain from being linked back to use. They do this using the CoinJoin protocol, the Tor anonymity network, and allow for manual coin labeling and selection. Security focused wallets are hardware wallets, cold storage, that allow you to store your bitcoin offline making them less vulnerable a range of different hacks. TIP: For privacy AND security, you can use a privacy wallet with a hardware wallet. SECOND TIP: Be extra cautious when using a mobile wallet. Consider only using mobile wallets for small values of bitcoin, since they are not great at privacy or security. Step 3: Decide if you want to validate your own transactions Running MyNode Being able to validate your own transactions is the only way to get the fully properties of the Bitcoin system. You can validate the entire history of the blockchain with a full node or just your own transactions with a light node/SPV Wallet. In either case, running something like MyNode is one of the simplest ways to get started with validating your bitcoin transactions." />
