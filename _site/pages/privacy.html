<p>Bickers & Son operates the getbitcoinclarity.com website. Bickers & Son understands that your privacy is important to you. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your personally-identifiable information as you use this website.

<h3>Personal And Non-personal Information</h3>

<p>Our Privacy Policy identifies how we treat your personal and non-personal information.</p>

<h3>What Is Non-personal Information And How Is It Collected And Used?</h3>

<p>Non personal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit this web site to read information, such as information about one of our services, we may collect certain non-personal information about you from your computer’s web browser. Because non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways that we can use or share non-personal information. What is personal information and how is it collected? Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, and fax number. We may collect personal information from you in a variety of ways: </p>

<ul>

<h3>Are Cookies Or Other Technologies Used To Collect Personal Information?</h3>

<p>Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our web site. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie helps Bickers & Son to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Bickers & Son website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the web site or to monitor how our users navigate the web site, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.</p>

<p>Third party vendors also may use cookies on our web site. For instance, we may contract with third parties who will use cookies on our web site to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and members. Such information is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. These third parties use persistent cookies to help us to improve the visitor experience, to manage our site content, and to track visitor behaviour. We may also contract with a third party to send e-mail to our registered [users/members].</p>

<p>To help measure and improve the effectiveness of our e-mail communications, the third party sets cookies. All data collected by this third party on behalf of Bickers & Son is used solely by or on behalf of Bickers & Son and is shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. From time to time we may allow third parties to post advertisements on our web site, and those third-party advertisements may include a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information collected from you by third party ad servers. We do not control cookies in such third party ads, and you should check the privacy policies of those advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology before linking to an ad.

As discussed in the section on cookies and other technologies, from time to time we may allow a third party to serve advertisements on this web site.
</p>

<h1>Data protection</h1>

<p>Bickers & Son is committed to providing a superior learning experience for everyone we work with.  We know that our users’ are committed to their success and we are equally committed to ensuring that each interaction that someone has with our content is optimized for maximum educational potential.  To enable us to do this, Bickers & Son needs to gather and use certain information about individuals.</p>

<p>Individuals who we gather information about includes customers, affiliates, business contacts, employees, and other people the organization has a relationship with or may need to contact.</p>

<p>This policy describes how this personal data is collected, handled, and stored to meet the company’s data protection standards — and to comply with the law.</p>

<h3>Why This Policy Exists</h3>

<p>This data protection policy ensures Bickers & Son:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Complies with data protection law and follows industry best practices</li>
    <li>Protects the rights of staff, customers, affiliates, and partners</li>
    <li>Is open about how it stores and processes individuals’ data</li>
    <li>Protects itself from the risks of a data breach</li>
</ul>

<h3>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Protection Law</h3>

<p>The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) protection law describes how organizations who conduct business with individuals or entities located in EU (European Union) nations — including Bickers & Son — must collect, handle, and store personal information.</p>

<p>These rules apply regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper, or in any other manner.</p>

<p>To comply with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely, and not disclosed unlawfully.</p>

<p>The EU GDPR is underpinned by eight core principles. These state that personal data must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Be processed fairly and lawfully</li>
    <li>Be obtained only for specific, lawful purposes</li>
    <li>Be adequate, relevant, and not excessive</li>
    <li>Be accurate and kept up to date</li>
    <li>Not be held for any longer than necessary</li>
    <li>Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects</li>
    <li>Be protected in appropriate ways</li>
    <li>Not be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), unless that country or territory also ensures an adequate level of protection</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. Policy Statement</h3>

<p>Every day our business will receive, use, and store personal information about our customers, affiliates, partners, and colleagues. It is important that this information is handled lawfully and appropriately, in line with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (collectively referred to as the ‘Data Protection Requirements’).</p>

<p>We take our data protection duties seriously, because we respect the trust that is being placed in us to use personal information appropriately and responsibly.</p>

<h3>2. About This Policy</h3>

<p>This policy and any other documents referred to in it, sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data that we collect or process. This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract of employment and may be amended at any time.</p>

<p>The company as a whole is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Data Protection Requirements and with this policy. Any questions about the operation of this policy or any concerns that the policy has not been followed should be referred in the first instance to the Data Protection Officer.</p>

<h3>3. What is Personal Data?</h3>

<p>Personal data is defined as data, (whether stored electronically or paper based) relating to a living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly from that data, (or from that data and other information in our possession).</p>

<p>Processing is any activity that involves use of personal data. It includes obtaining, recording, or holding the data, organizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing, or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties under privacy control conditions.</p>

<p>Sensitive personal data includes contact info, address, session activity on the platform, IP location etc. Sensitive personal data can only be processed under strict conditions, and used for express purpose that it was collected for.</p>

<h3>4. Data Protection Principles</h3>

<p>Anyone processing personal data, must ensure that data is:</p>

<ol type="A">
    <li>Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner.</li>
    <li>Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and any further processing is completed for a compatible purpose.</li>
    <li>Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the intended purposes.</li>
    <li>Accurate and where necessary, kept up to date.</li>
    <li>Kept in a form which permits identification for no longer than necessary for the intended purposes.</li>
    <li>Processed in line with the individual’s rights and in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.</li>
    <li>Not transferred to people or organizations situated in countries without adequate protection and without firstly having advised the individual.</li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Fair and Lawful Processing</h3>

<p>The Data Protection Requirements are not intended to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the individual.</p>

<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we will only process personal data where it is required for a lawful purpose. The lawful purposes include (amongst others): whether the individual has given their consent, the processing is necessary for performing a contract with the individual, for compliance with a legal obligation, or for the legitimate interest of the business. When sensitive personal data is being processed, additional conditions must be met.</p>

<ol type="A">
    <li>
        <p>Collection of Information</p>

</ul>

<p>Subject to the requirements above, personal data we hold may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

<h3>15. Subject Access Requests</h3>

<p>To these ends, the company has a privacy statement setting out how data relating to individuals is used by the company.</p>

<p>Individuals must make a formal request for information we hold about them. Employees who receive a request should forward it to the data department immediately.</p>
