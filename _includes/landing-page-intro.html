        <div class="about-content">
          <p>News outlets, social media news feeds, Reddit, and Bitcoin twitter are all noise. The internet hivemind is crowded with swarms of people talking about whatever's trending, and chasing the next shiny object. The diaglog on these platforms is short-term, and people are lost because of it.</p><br>
          <p>It's too easy to see cryptocurrency a tangled knot of chaos. I show you how to separate signal from the noise, and how to take the time to understand Bitcoin first, before moving on to other opportunities.</p>

              <p><i>I'm not here to hype Bitcoin, I'm here to <u>promote understanding</u>.</i><br></p><br>
              <p>When I wanted to learn more about Bitcoin I spent years studying economics, markets, and learning how to code. But it wasnâ€™t until I learned about this concept of systems thinking, and how to frame that knowledge into mental models that I saw success in explaining these complicated concepts to other people quickly, without all those years that I've invested.</p><br>
              <p>I've spent years working in this industry, and I wrote Bitcoin Clarity and a training program to go with it. My goal is to give you a Bitcoin help desk with the technical expertise, and financial literacy that this gig requires. In this training, you'll get the cheat sheet to work with crypto, and a personal guide to help you through it.</p>
