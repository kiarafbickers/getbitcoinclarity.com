            <p>Let's be honest, most people aren't buying into Bitcoin because they expect to use it peer-to-peer. Most people are buying it for the hype. Hype draws people in like flies on a dead possum. Which is to say, that once people are drawn in, they don't care what brought them there.</p>
            <p>If you want a straight-forward way to separate the signal from the hype, to understand Bitcoin as a system, I've put together the <a href="https://app.getbitcoinclarity.com/courses/bitcoin-clarity-accelerator">Accelerator Program</a> to explain everything you need to know with the beauty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUBQPIk9Wh8">Vivaldi's storm.</a></p>

                <p>This is not a conventional 'newsletterâ€™. It's not about day trading your way to millions and a Lambo. It's also not a fancy consortium of ghost blockchain advisors and consultants, <b>but it is a pretty damn good newsletter</b>. It's the intangible sum of all of everything I've written about Bitcoin, books, and whatever else tickles my fancy.</p>
